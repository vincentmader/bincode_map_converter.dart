#+title: Bincode Map Converter

This is a dart module I wrote for facilitating the conversion of Dart `Map` objects to and from binary representation as `List<int>`.

It can be (and is) used for e.g. sending & receiving Dart objects via TCP/UDP.

For using it, all that needs to be done is defining a `.toMap()` method and a `.fromMap()` constructor for your Dart classes.

The repository's name is lent from the awesome Rust crate [[https://docs.rs/bincode/latest/bincode/][bincode]].
